# Metric-Imperial Converter

- Took design from Figma file and replicated in HTML/CSS
- Used JavaScript to calculate metric/imperial conversions
- Included an input box to allow user to change value easily

## Further development

- Add in button to choose what conversion you see (mass/volume/length) instead of seeing all three at once
- Add in other types to convert, e.g. inches to centimetres, ounces to grams
